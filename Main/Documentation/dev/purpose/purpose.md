# Purpose
This page makes an overall introduction to the CRM / service documentation. Please use the menu to navigate through the documentation.
L-mobile CRM / service project is expanding with its growing codebase. However, without strict conventions on the project structure, the growth of the project also increases the chances that some code will eventually be overridden by some other while making it harder to debug the problems and understand how the program flow works.
